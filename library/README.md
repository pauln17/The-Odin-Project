# Library
A virtual library allowing users to store the books they are reading and its contents to keep track, such as title, author, total pages, and amount of pages read. HTML and CSS is used for a responsive layout with a library display made from CSS grid. JS is used to dynamically update the library display and allow users to add books and edit book information.
