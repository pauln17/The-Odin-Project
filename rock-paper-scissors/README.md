# Rock Paper Scissors Game
A website that allows users to play against a computer in rock, paper, scissors.

The website uses HTML and CSS to create the design/layout and then JavaScript to add the interactive touches such as the player choosing their hand through buttons which will then display the results of the player and the computer and then tally the results.
